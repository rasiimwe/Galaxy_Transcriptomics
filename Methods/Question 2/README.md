# Question 2: Are the transcriptomic changes in blood the same as in the other tissues after SIV infection?

To answer this question we did the following:

1. Looked at the number of overlapping probes between tissues using the hit list generated while answering question 1 and generated Venn diagrams   
2. Compared fold changes of gene expression in overlapping probes to determine similarity of expression patterns between tissues 

See [question2.md](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_SIV-in-Rhesus-Monkeys/blob/master/Methods/Question%202/question2.md) for full methodology and outputs.
