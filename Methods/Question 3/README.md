# Question 3: Do transcriptomic changes in lymph node tissues vary by lymph node location?

To answer this question we did the following:

1. Design contrast matricies to compare lymph node tissues 
2. Fit linear models to observe differences in gene expression based on lymph node location
    * Fit linear models both including an excluding the interaction of daysxtissue
3. Generate a hit list of differentially expressed genes between lymph tissues
4. Conduct unsupervised hierarchical clustering and PCA of samples
