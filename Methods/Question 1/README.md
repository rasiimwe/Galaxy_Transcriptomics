# Question 1: How does gene expression change in various tissues after SIV infection? 

To answer this question we did the following: 
1. [Fit linear models](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_SIV-in-Rhesus-Monkeys/tree/master/Methods/Question%201/Linear%20Models) for each tissue 
2. Identified differentially expressed genes within each tissue (FDR cutoff <= 0.05) 
3. Conducted [gene enrichment analysis](https://github.com/STAT540-UBC/team_SIV-in-Rhesus-Monkeys/tree/master/Methods/Question%201/Gene%20Set%20Enrichment%20Analysis) of hits via. GO annotation, KEGG allignent and DAVID analysis for biological inference
